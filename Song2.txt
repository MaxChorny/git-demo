I put you high up in the sky,
And now you’re not coming down.
It slowly turned; you let me burn,
And now we’re ashes on the ground.


 I came in like a wrecking ball.
     Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung.
     Left me crouching in a blazing fall.
     All you ever did was break me.
     Yeah, you, you wreck me.

Don’t you ever say I just walked away.
   I will always want you.
   I can’t live a lie, running for my life.
   I will always want you.
